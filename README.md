*DESCRIPTION* :

As part of my frontend web development internship, I was assigned the task of creating a fully functional and personal portfolio website. This project was designed to help me showcase my technical skills, project work, and personal background, while also reinforcing core web development concepts like responsive design, semantic HTML, and clean CSS layout structuring.

#Objective
The main objective of this task was to create a personal branding website that could be used by professionals to present themselves effectively online. It had to include specific sections such as an "About Me" summary, a project showcase, contact information, and a footer with proper attribution. The project was to be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on frameworks or libraries.

#Technologies Used
->HTML5 for semantic structure
->CSS3 for styling and responsive design
->Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (hamburger menu toggle)
->Google Fonts for custom typography
->Font Awesome (optional) for icon support (GitHub or social links)

#Structure of the Website
The portfolio website includes the following key sections:

=>Header & Navigation Bar:

A fixed navigation bar featuring links to About, Projects, and Contact sections.
A hamburger menu for mobile responsiveness.

=>Hero Section:

A short introduction headline.

A call-to-action button leading to the projects section.

=>About Me:

A summary of my background, development interests, and design approach.

=>Projects Section:

=>Highlights of two completed projects:

Advocate Management System (AdvoCase): A PHP-based solution for law professionals.

Nursery Management System (Earthly Delights): A web system for plant and nursery management.

=>Contact Section:

My email address and phone number for direct contact.

Footer:

A GitHub link to this portfolio repository.

#What I Learned
During the execution of this internship task, I significantly improved my skills in:

Writing clean and semantic HTML structure
Implementing mobile responsive designs with CSS
Using flexbox for layout structuring
Handling basic interactivity using JavaScript (like mobile nav toggle)
Embedding icons and fonts from external libraries

Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how to organize content for personal branding and how to make a portfolio more accessible and visually appealing.

Outcome
This task was a hands-on learning opportunity that allowed me to apply what Iâ€™ve studied in a practical, real-world scenario. The final result is a professional and visually clean portfolio site that I can now use for future job or freelance opportunities. It also serves as a solid foundation to build more advanced features like project filtering, testimonials, or blog integration in the future.
